This project discusses the search for relationships between each variable in the Super Bowl National Football League (NFL), both variables in aspects of American soccer games, TV, and musical performance. Data is provided in the form of .csv obtained from Wikipedia. After examining and cleaning up the data, a conclusion can be drawn:

- The most extreme match results.
- How the soccer game affects the audience.
- How viewers change, TV ratings, and advertising costs every time.
- the most productive music player in the Super Bowl event.
